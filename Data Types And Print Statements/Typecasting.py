# The Typecasting In Python Is Like Coverting One Data Type To Another Like This

a = "20"
b = "30"

print(int(a) + int(b))

# There Are 2 Types Of Typecasting
# 1) Explicit Typecasting
# 2) Implicit Typecasting

#Explicit Typecasting Is Which Is Converted By Developer Or Programmer
#Implicit Typecasting Is Which Is Converted By Python Interpreter 

#Like This 
a = 1.8
b = 8

print(a + b )
